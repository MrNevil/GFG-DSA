# Introduction to Sorting:  
  
**Sorting** any sequence means to arrange the elements of that sequence according to some specific criterion.  

For Example, the array arr[] = {5, 4, 2, 1, 3} after sorting in increasing order will be: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The same array after sorting in descending order will be: arr[] = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}.  

**In-Place Sorting:** An in-place sorting algorithm uses constant extra space for producing the output (modifies the given array only). It sorts the list only by modifying the order of the elements within the list.  

In this tutorial, we will see three of such in-place sorting algorithms, namely:  
+ Insertion Sort  
+ Selection Sort  
+ Bubble Sort
